Hello, my name is Gunnar Sorensen, and I am a Back-End Software Engineer with a passion for analyzing and solving complex technical problems in a team environment. My 17-year background coaching Alpine Ski Racing, which spread from teaching first-timers to coaching Olympic-level athletes in their quest to find those extra hundredths of a second, helped hone my skills in collaboration with diverse teams with a variety of end goals. In Addition, I learned to work through complex technical challenges in high-pressure environments to help others perform at their highest level possible.

While I believe everyone's needs for development are different, I think the goal is the same: Identify the problem, formulate a solution, test the results, and repeat until the goal is accomplished. I firmly believe that my skills in identifying technical issues, communicating them with the clients, and then working collaboratively with a team to tackle those problems will be an asset to any organization.

When not behind the computer, you can find me in the Mountains camping and mountaineering with my dog Sakic! I also have a passion for food (making and eating), and you will never see me pass up the opportunity to enjoy an excellent Thai Green Curry.
